To represent strings, you can use single quotes, double quotes, or even backticks(that's new for me). It is important to note that although every type of string representation supports escaping with a backslash(\), strings created with backticks can have special character without the need for escaping. Backticks also supports template literals, basically the action of embedding new other values and even programming logic using the syntax "${}".
