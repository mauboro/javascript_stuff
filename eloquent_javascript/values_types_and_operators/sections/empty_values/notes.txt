There are two special values that are used to denote the absence of any meaninful value and those are "null" and "undefined". Many operations in the languages that don't result to any meaninful value will yield null or undefined. The difference between those two is simply an accident of JavaScript design and although they do have a difference, most of the times they can be used interchangeably.
