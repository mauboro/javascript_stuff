You can write a JavaScript number type value by just declaring it as : 7, the fractional version of it is 7.0, you even can use exponent notation to express large or very small numbers like : 7.0e8 = 7.0 * 10**8. Because of the limitation of 64 bits(considering the bits allocated to express negative and decimal numbers) calculations smaller than 9 quadrillion are guaranteed to be precise. But is important to remember that calculations with fractional number may not always be precise. Just like pi cannot be precisely expressed by a finite number of decimal digits, many numbers lose some precision when only 64 bits are available to store them.
