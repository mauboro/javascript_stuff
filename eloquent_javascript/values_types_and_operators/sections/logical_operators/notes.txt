There also the famous logical operators &&, ||, !(expression) and ?, respectively, and, or, not and the only ternary operator called the conditional operator: ?, the only operator that can take three values. In a example like (true ? 1 : 2), the value before the question mark is used to pick between the two values before the question mark, if its true is returns the first(1) and if its false it return the second(2). Operators also have an order of precedence in an expression that occupies a place below all other numerical operators, this order is ascending as follows: ||, &&, the comparison operators and the rest.
