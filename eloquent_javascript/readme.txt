Here I will expose my methodology of dissecting the book "Eloquent JavaScript". First, I will read it just like any other book. After that, I will make notes of the concepts exposed in the book by section and then I will use the same logic with the code exposed in the book. Almost as like the way I'm approaching the deepdive python course. I will put a mark on the directory that correspond to the chapter I am currently in because of the compartmentalizational effect that the pomodoro study method yields.
